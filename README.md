# desyre
Code for the deep synthesis regularization paper.

The code contains the optimization algorithm used for DESYRE and includes a short demo script.


The `demo.py` script reads the networks from the `models/paper/` folder to reconstruct a box phantom from given noisy measurements.

The networks used for this demonstration can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g7v6ao68mcugi06/AACm4JQDAX19Wn-WM4x09e3Ta?dl=0. Extract these networks to the `models/paper/` folder and run the `demo.py` script.
